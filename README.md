# MistyMaze
2D Maze type game

## Basic info:

- Game written in Java 14
- No additional libraries/game engines used
- IntelliJ was my IDE
- WSAD movement

## Rules:
- Your mission is to escape from the first, second and third maze level 
- You can only escape after collecting all keys that are scattered somewhere around
- After collecting all of them you need to find the exit, the next level is loaded after a successful escape
- Mist around you will drive you crazy 
- Each move costs some health, so don't move without any sense - there is no time limit so take your time
- If your health will reach 0, then you die and it is game over
- Have fun
